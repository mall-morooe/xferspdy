# boilerplate-project-urlshortener-forge

lightweight web toolkit for prototypes

## why this exists

i needed something that just works without reading 50 pages of docs.

## install

```bash
npm i boilerplate-project-urlshortener-forge
```

## use it

```js
import tool from 'boilerplate-project-urlshortener-forge'
tool({ input: 'data.json' })
```

## tech

runs on setup, probably buggy

## limitations

- docs incomplete
- not production ready

made by someone tired of overengineering
